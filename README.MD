# Pull up a chair, setup your tent, and nestle into your temporary home :tent: 
VMs function much like a campsite, You setup, get everything *just* the way you like it, live there for awhile, and then leave. 
This script aims to be the new RV that makes the whole process a lot simpler (I know this analogy has some issues but we're going to ignore that)



## Future plans: 
* Add more tools to be installed
* Create roles so this can be used for hacking VMs and Dev VMs without a need to manually specify
